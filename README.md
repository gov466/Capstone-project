## IOT BASED  CAR OVER SPEED DETECTION SYSTEM 
This repository is created  for completing our capstone project as a professional means of communication platform  between  group members as well as our project guide.

### Project description:
Over-speeding of cars has caused many road accidents over the years. There needs to be a system which can detect the over speeding of cars. When a car goes beyond the prescribed speed limit, a detection system should be able to detect it. Also, the system will be able to display the speed of the given vehicle on the screen.
